# Console-Finances
This application uses basic HTML to display an instruction to view the console and then JavaScript to provide data analysis on a set of data presented in an array.
The data analysis calculates the number of values in the array, the total of the money displayed in the array (located in the second place within each entry in the array), the average change between entries and the maximum and minimum changes.

The application can be found at:  https://steve4098.github.io/Console-Finances/
